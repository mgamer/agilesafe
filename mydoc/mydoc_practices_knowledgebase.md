## Overview
A knowledge base of software development and management practices, both agile and disciplined, created for the needs of projects that use AgileSafe.
The AgileSafe Practices Knowledge Base has been implemented in OWL using Protege tool. The rules and reasoning applied to the knowledge base are part of the Practices Selecetion Process.
## Collection of Practices in the Practices Knowledge Base
In order to calibrate the method, the Practices Knowledge Base has been populated with a set of 50 chosen software development practices, ranging from the flagship agile practices to the disciplined, high ceremony ones.
The list of these Practices can be found [here](files/AgileSafe_50Practices_List.pdf).
