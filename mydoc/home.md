## Motivation

While plan-driven methodologies have proven its value and usefulness in safety-critical projects, the evolving market of software products of the last few years puts this approach to the test. A growing competition, ever changing technologies and more diverse groups of clients have changed the expectations towards software development methods. The need to deliver systems of acceptable quality, faster and at lower cost in comparison to competitors evoked seeking alternative hybrid approaches where agility is combined with necessary safety assurance. In my research I attempt to answer their needs in a relevant and intelligible way by introducing AgileSafe method.

## Goals

The AgileSafe method provides a user with tools enabling him to create, with a help of guidelines and questionnaires, a hybrid agile approach customized for his project. What is even more important, it delivers a solution for handling conformance with standards and norms when introducing the new approach. 

By introducing a hybrid agile approach the Client might gain:

* **Cost reduction.** Incorporating agile practices can reduce the overheads by introducing agile techniques. The cost of a change in requirements can be significantly reduced. 
* **Improvement of maintenance.** Change management and change following can become the backbone of the whole process. Agile methodologies respond better to often-changing requirements as they embrace the change by definition.  
* **Improving stakeholders involvement.** Agile approach promotes client engagement which provides for continuous feedback. This can be extended to the broader scope of stakeholders. 
* **Increased productivity.** There are well documented achievements in improving teamsâ€™ efficiency while using agile methodologies (in comparison to the plan-driven ones) . Teams tend to work faster and require less team members for the same tasks. 
* **Meeting quality objectives.** Incorporating agile practices into software development can provide essential techniques for delivering the system in short time when there is a pressure on quick delivery while maintaining high quality.

**The AgileSafe method can help the Client to obtain the above while meeting safety requirements.** 

## Target Audience

AgileSafe method is addressed mainly to safety-critical SMEs, to support them in the process of introducing new practices into their software development.
