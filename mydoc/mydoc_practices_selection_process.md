## Overview
In order to support users while selecting the software engineering practices from the AgileSafe Practices Knowledge Base, AgileSafe offers the guidance, which is based on Project characteristics and Regulatory Compliance requirements. The practices maintained in the AgileSafe Practices Knowledge Base include both plan-driven and agile methods documented in the literature, and may also include custom developed hybrid practices. Upon the selection of the practices an assurance argument is composed along with assurance arguments for selected standards.
Users are able to introduce their own practices into the Knowledge Base.
