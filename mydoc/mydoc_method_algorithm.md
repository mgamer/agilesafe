The customized Project Practices Set, prepared in the AS.P.2 Select practices process, should be later implemented in the software development process (AS.P.7 Apply Practices). 
For each given Standard a Practices Compliance Argument need to be developed/updated (AS.P.3). T
hese Practices Compliance Arguments are then adapted (AS.P.4), depending on the PPS, into Project Practices Compliance Arguments. Based on them, the Project Compliance Arguments are prepared (AS.P.5) and they are the end products of the method allowing the user to AS.P.6 Assert conformance, using the Evidence prepared during the AS.P.7 Apply practices process.
