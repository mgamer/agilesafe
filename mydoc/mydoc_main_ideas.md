AgileSafe method is addressed mainly to safety-critical SMEs, to support them in the process of introducing new practices into their software development. 

In order to ensure the required safety level in a given project has been acquired or maintained, AgileSafe uses a set of assurance cases. The main idea behind this set is to provide assurance cases both for the software development process and for the end product itself. While the latter is the essence of demonstrating product conformance with a given standard or a guideline, the former is a mean to obtain it, a technique that will allow a company to ensure the practices they’re choosing are suitable for this particular project with its safety requirements imposed by standards. 

The method has been designed to be as universal as possible by which I mean it can be adapted to suit various safety-critical domains. For demonstration reasons I decided to concentrate on medical software field but it can easily cater for other fields. In order to keep it independent from the type of product being produced in the analyzed process, the assurance arguments are based on the standards structure. It means that instead of treating specific product-related list of risks as a base for an assurance argument, it is being built upon the applicable standard and then specified for the given project. The motivations behind this are explained more in-depth in the section concerning Assurance arguments.


The main end products of AgileSafe method are:

*	Project Practices Set – a custom prepared hybrid approach;
*	Assurance arguments for the customized set of practices, for each given standard;
