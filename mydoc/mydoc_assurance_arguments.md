## Overview

In order to ensure the required safety level in a given project has been acquired or maintained, AgileSafe uses a set of assurance cases. The main idea behind this set is to provide assurance cases both for the software development process and for the end product itself. While the latter is the essence of demonstrating product conformance with a given standard or a guideline, the former is a mean to obtain it, a technique that will allow a company to ensure the practices theyâ€™re choosing are suitable for this particular project with its safety requirements imposed by standards. 

The idea of assurance arguments is used in AgileSafe method on two levels: one is for software development practices- the process and the other concerns the product. 
While the concept of using assurance arguments for demonstrating conformity to the standards has already been discussed, introducing an additional level of argument is a more innovative concept. Both Practices Compliance Template and Project Compliance Template are part of this level.
All of the arguments in the method are developed separately for each applicable standard in order to support separate certification processes and are based on the standard structure.
