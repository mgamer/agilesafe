## Overview

In order to ensure that the required safety level in a given project has been acquired or maintained, AgileSafe uses a set of assurance cases: Practices Compliance Arguments, Project Practices Compliance Arguments and Project Compliance Arguments.

The main idea behind this set is to provide assurance cases both for the software development process and for the end product itself. While the latter is the essence of demonstrating product conformance with a given standard or a guideline, the former is a mean to obtain it, a technique that will allow company to ensure that the practices theyâ€™re choosing are suitable for this particular project with its safety requirements imposed by standards. 
To handle assurance cases AgileSafe follows the TRUST-IT methodology  and uses the Argevide NOR-STA services.
